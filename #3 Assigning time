I think I need to first start small, then modify my path as I progress. Creating a perfect image from a blank slate is more difficult than modifying repeatedly. 

For now I need to assign myself different tasks depending on different times. I am losing much time when I am not doing anything with the time.   With less time I'll be more efficient with it.  

I think time management includes not only finding whatever time you can find and out it to productivity, but also managing to recreate, form social bond while not allowing any time to waste. Your time may get wasted a little anyway but, you won't be missing any vital parts of life be it bonding, taking care of your well-being, experiencing new experience.
